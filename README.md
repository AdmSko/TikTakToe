# TikTakToe
Right now it's a working Tic Tac Toe game. Game was fully made with C# also using Forms.
In Future:
There will be a data base system that collects scores and player names.
Everything when you enter player names, program will check if player1 played with player2 - score will be loaded, added 
Possibility to generate JPG/bitmap which will contain player names with score and other graphic fantasies
Creating web version of game connected with the same database
some kind of ranking(?)
